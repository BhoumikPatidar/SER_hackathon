ElevenLabs Emotional Speech Dataset Generator

This script generates emotional speech samples using ElevenLabs Eleven v3 Audio Tags.
Audio Tags like [angry], [excited], [sad] provide emotional direction WITHOUT being spoken aloud.

Requirements:
- ElevenLabs API key in .env file
- Access to Eleven v3 model (currently in alpha)

Features:
- 7 emotions: happy, anger, disgust, neutral, fear, surprise, sad
- 10 diverse voice IDs for speaker variety
- Audio Tags for precise emotional control
- Optimized voice settings for v3 model
